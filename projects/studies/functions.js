 * 
 * 2. What is the diff b/w parameters and arguments PASSED to a function
 * 
 * 3. What's the syntax for a Named functions?
 * 
 * 4. How do we assign a function to a variable
 * 
 * 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value.  How do we specify inputs and how do we
 * specify outputs?
 * 
 * 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true
 * 
 * 7. Closures: Functinos form closures around the data they house. If an object returned form the function
 * and is held in memory somwehere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE and can continue to live in these closures!
